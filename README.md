# Code-Samples-for-Students
Code samples for my students

This repo is intended to be a reference guide (with comments about how different code elements work) for students in my classes.

Each directory has its own readme with examples that could be added to that folder. I am open to adding new directories if there are other low level topics that I have not mentioned.
